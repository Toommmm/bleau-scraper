# bleauScraper

Hobby project to test my Python / HTML / CSS skills.

Also a project to retrieve topo's from new/updated areas from [bleau.info](http://www.bleau.info), with some additional info. 

## How to use

Run the code with
```
./run_scraper https://bleau.info/topos/topo1176.html
``` 
to scrape a single topo page. When you leave out the optional URL, all areas in `areas.txt` are scraped.
